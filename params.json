This aim is to provide a GUI for the Modeling & Simulation of PyDEVS and PyPDEVS models. PyDEVS is an API allowing the implementation of the DEVS formalism in Python language. PyPDEVS is the parallel version of PyDEVS based on Parallel DEVS formalism which is an extension of the DEVS formalism. The DEVSimPy environment has been developed in Python with the wxPython graphical library without strong dependencies other than the Scipy and the Numpy scientific python libraries. The basic idea behind DEVSimPy is to wrap the PyDEVS API with a GUI allowing significant simplification of handling PyDEVS/PyPDEVS models (like the coupling between models or their storage into libraries).\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n\r\nThe use of DEVSimPy requires:\r\n\r\n* Python version 2.4+\r\n* wxPython version 2.6+ ansi/unicode (unicode recommended)\r\n* Scipy and Numpy (optional, for spectrum analysis)\r\n* DEVSimPy should be used like a normal Python file, i.e., double-clicking on the devsimpy.py file which is located in the root directory or writing python devismpy.py into a python console.\r\n* Users which don't want to install python with all dependency can use Portable Python (version 2.x). Then, just extract DEVSimPy archive and edit the devsimpy.py file with PyScripter to execute it.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\nWith DEVSimPy we can:\r\n\r\n* Model a DEVS system and save or export it into a library\r\n* Edit the code of DEVS model to modify behavior's also during the simulation\r\n* Import existing library of models (python code or DEVSimPy specific models) which allows the specific domain modeling (Power system, continuous, etc)\r\n* Automatically simulate the system and perform its analysis during the simulation (with the suspend option)\r\n* Load plug-ins to extend DEVSimPy in order to perform activity tracking, trace the simulation with visual tools, etc.\r\n* Generate YAML models for the DEVSimPy-mob mobile application.\r\n* and more.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\nDEVSimPy don't require installation and works on all platforms. To launch DEVSimPy, you need to execute the devsimpy.py file into a Python prompt:\r\n\r\n$ python devsimpy.py",
